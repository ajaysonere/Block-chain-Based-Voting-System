# Blockchain-Based Voting System

This is a blockchain-based voting system that allows secure and transparent voting using distributed ledger technology. The system uses a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain to manage the voting process and store the results.

# Getting Started

To get started with the system, you will need the following:

* A computer with an internet connection
* A web3-enabled browser, such as MetaMask
* Ether to pay for transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain

# Installation

To install the system, follow these steps:

### Steps to compile the contract
* Clone the repo
* cd Voting-dapp/contract-folder
* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Run truffle in a terminal: `truffle develop`
* Compile the code: `compile`
* Migrate the code: `migrate --reset`

### Steps to run the forntend application
* Copy and paste the json file generated after migrating the contract in the src directory.
* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Make sure truffle is running in a terminal. If not then run truffle with the command: `truffle develop`
* Open metamask and create accounts for voters and candidates
* Run the react app: `npm start`

# Usage
To use the system, follow these steps:

* Open the index.html file in a web3-enabled browser
* Connect to your Ethereum wallet using MetaMask or another web3 provider
* Enter the address of the smart contract and the number of candidates in the election
* Cast your vote by selecting a candidate and submitting the transaction
* Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain
*  View the results of the election by querying the smart contract
